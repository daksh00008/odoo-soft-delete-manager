            <p><strong>Manage soft delete functionality for Odoo models seamlessly.</strong></p>
            <p>
                This module enables administrators to configure soft delete functionality for selected Odoo models.
                Instead of permanently deleting records, they are marked as deleted and can be recovered or permanently
                removed using a wizard. Perfect for preventing accidental data loss and managing data retention policies.
